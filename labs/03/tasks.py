    1 point
    Open file located at `source`, read its lines and sort them.
    Then output the sorted lines to the file located at `target`.

    Return 'ok' if everything was successful.
    Return 'file not found' if the `source` file was not found (FileNotFoundError).
    Return 'error' if anything else went wrong.

    Example:
        sort_file('from.txt', 'to.txt') == 'ok'

    2 points
    Create a decorator that caches the latest function result.
    When `f` is called multiple times in a row with the same parameter, compute the result just
    once and then return the result from cache.
    When `f` receives a different parameter, reset the cache and compute the new result.
    Assume that `f` receives exactly one parameter.
    Example:
        @cached

            return a + 1 # imagine an expensive computation

        fn(1) == 2 # computed

    Write a generator that traverses `tree` in the given `order` ('inorder', 'preorder' or 'postorder').
